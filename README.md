Objective:
The Rock Paper Scissors game will be a simple game that involves using the player's webcam to play rounds of Rock Paper Scissors with a computer opponent. The game consists of multiple rounds, in which the winner will move up in a "tier" if they win and the loser will move down. The first player to reach the 0 tier loses the game, and the first player to reach the 8 tier wins the game. The players may also utilize powerups to help them in a round.

This is the intial scenario for the interface. Both players start at Tier 4.

In this phase, the user has taken a photo of their hand and started the round. The webcam recognizes the symbol and compares it to the computer player to decide who wins the round.

![phase2](Project2_Sketches/HICProject2_phase2.png)
This scenario is similar to the previous one, but this time the player has earned power ups! These will appear on the bottom of the screen, and the player can click on the icon to use the powerup.

![phase3](Project2_Sketches/HICProject2_phase3.png)
In this scenario, the player has used a powerup to help them in the round.

![phase4](Project2_Sketches/HICProject2_phase4.png)
Because the player used a powerup in the previous round, they have moved up in tiers and are close to winning.
